# database_based_on_diagramme

> We have been given a database diagram, so we had to interpret it, and implement the SQL needed to build that database.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database: - [schema.sql](./schema.sql) for creating all tables. - [data.sql](./data.sql) for populating tables with sample data. - [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database.
